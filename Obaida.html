            <p> Hello, my name is Obaida Kamil. Enthusiastic and driven, I am a recent computer science graduate from Western University, with a passion for crafting innovative digital solutions through web development and programming. 
              My journey began with a fascination for technology during my formative years, leading me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I not only acquired a strong foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and data structures but also cultivated a deep curiosity for the dynamic world of web development.
              In my free time, I enjoy painting when I am inspired and being with my friends.
